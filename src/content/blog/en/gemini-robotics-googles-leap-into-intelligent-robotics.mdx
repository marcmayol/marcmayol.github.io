Once again, Google, through its DeepMind lab, continues to drive the future of artificial intelligence and robotics with Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, two innovative projects that integrate the most advanced capabilities of Gemini 2.0 into interactive, skilled, and general-purpose robots.
<br/>
Gemini Robotics uses an advanced combination of vision, language, and action to enable robots to operate in dynamic, real-world environments, where they must immediately adapt to changing instructions and new situations. These robots not only react but also reason and generalize, even when faced with tasks they have never encountered before.
<br/>
According to Google, for robots to be truly useful, they must meet three essential qualities: being interactive, general, and skilled.

## Real time interactivity
One of the main features of Gemini Robotics is its ability to intuitively interact with people and continuously adapt to its environment. Based on Gemini 2.0, these robots understand and respond fluently to everyday language, detect changes in their surroundings, and adjust their actions in real time. For example, if an object is moved or the robot receives a new instruction, the response is immediate, enabling effective and natural collaboration.
<br/>

## General purpose robots
Gemini Robotics stands out especially for its ability to generalize, that is, to solve new tasks by leveraging its advanced understanding of the physical world provided by Gemini 2.0. A concrete example shown by Google is when a robot is given the instruction to match the number on two dice, a task it performs accurately not with predefined movements, but by reasoning how to manipulate the object in real time. This ability to generalize goes even further, allowing the robot to carry out previously unseen actions like "pick up a basketball and dunk it," using learned abstract concepts as a reference.
<br/>

## Skill for complex tasks and advanced spatial reasoning
Finally, Google has emphasized that one of the major challenges in robotics is equipping robots with the dexterity needed to perform complex manual tasks with precision. Gemini Robotics, and especially Gemini Robotics ER, face this challenge by demonstrating impressive skills such as folding origami or carefully packing food — everyday tasks that may seem simple for humans but require extremely advanced fine motor control and deep spatial reasoning.
<br/>

Google claims that Gemini Robotics represents a significant advancement compared to previous models, doubling performance on average in evaluations of vision, language, and action tasks. In addition, it is collaborating with leading companies such as Apptronik, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools to develop and validate the new generation of intelligent robots.<br/>

## Strategic collaborations and future developments
Google is collaborating with leading companies such as Apptronik, Agile Robots, Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools to develop and validate the new generation of intelligent robots. These partnerships aim to accelerate the integration of Gemini Robotics into various robotic platforms, from industrial arms to humanoid robots, expanding its applicability across multiple sectors.
<br/>

## Commitment to safety and ethics
Google DeepMind emphasizes the importance of safety in the development of these technologies. The models of Gemini Robotics are designed to assess the safety of an action before executing it, ensuring that the operations performed by the robots are safe and beneficial for humans. In addition, safety frameworks have been implemented to identify and mitigate potential harmful behaviors in advanced artificial intelligence systems.
<br/>
With this new generation of intelligent robots, Google aims to transform the interaction between humans and machines, bringing general purpose robotics closer to our daily lives, whether at home or in the workplace, in an effective and safe way.
