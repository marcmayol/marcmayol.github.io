				I'm Marc, a Tech Lead specializing in Generative AI and a passionate enthusiast of this fascinating field. With experience in developing AI applications, I strive to create intelligent systems that can make a positive impact on the world.
				Above all, I'm a geek about just about everything you can imagine anime, video games, TV shows, movies, books, comics, and more. But most of all, I'm a tech nerd who loves learning and sharing knowledge with others.

				<p class="text-gray-700">
					Ever since I was a kid growing up in Mallorca, I've had an insatiable curiosity for understanding how things work. I used to take apart toys, electronic devices, and pretty much anything that landed in my hands, not to break them, but to uncover their inner workings and learn. That same curiosity is what eventually led me to become an engineer and, later on, to dedicate myself to the world of artificial intelligence.<br/>
					<br/>
					Today, I'm an AI developer and educator. I combine technical development with teaching because I firmly believe that knowledge, when shared, multiplies. I'm passionate about creating solutions that truly work ones that go beyond being flashy to become genuinely useful tools. At the same time, I enjoy teaching, breaking down complex concepts into simple explanations, and helping others discover the potential of AI.				</p>

				<p class="text-gray-700">
					One of the projects that best represents this way of working is PromptSuite, a library I developed to manage prompts in a structured way, with specific versions for each model, in both JSON and SQL formats. It was born out of a real need, and I designed it with versatility, security, and clarity in mind for anyone who uses it.				<br/>

				<p class="text-gray-700">
					But I don’t stop there. I write articles, create content, and take part in initiatives where AI isn’t just a trend, but a purposeful tool. I'm especially interested in how intelligent agents can become useful, valuable, and marketable products for businesses. I'm convinced that this is one of the keys to the future: building systems that not only automate, but also understand, suggest, and evolve alongside us.					<br/>
					<br/>
					I keep learning every day, exploring new paths, and sharing what I discover. If there’s one thing I’ve learned along the way, it’s that technology only makes sense when it improves people’s lives. And that’s what I continue to work on.			</div>
